                        The Unit of Measurement API provides a set of Java language programming interfaces for handling units and quantities.
                        The interfaces provide a layer which separates client code, that would call the API,
                        from library code, which implements the API.<br/>

                        The specification contains Interfaces and abstract classes with methods for unit operations:<br/>
                        <br/><ul>
                            <li>Checking of unit compatibility</li>
                            <li>Expression of a quantity in various units</li>
                            <li>Arithmetic operations on units</li>

                        </ul>
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Developers frequently encounter the need to model units of measure, because objects in the real world are subject to these measures.
                        When working with units, developers need to understand the mathematics of units, how to convert between systems,
                        and how to format and parse string representations of units. Most of this work can be consolidated into one or two Java packages,
                        which is a primary aim of this JSR. This package will help developers create safe, correct software to deal with common problem of modeling units.
